The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.\n\nc. There was no change in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company\u2019s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThe Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases"}, {"idx": 1, "keywords": ["ERP system implementation", "internal control over financial reporting", "testing for effectiveness", "financial and related transaction processes"], "content": " over the next several years. The implementation of a worldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.\n\nThe Company completed implementation with respect to various processes/sub-processes in certain subsidiaries/locations, including aspects relative to the United States, and will continue to roll out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement, this application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of its evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the implementation of the ERP system in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n# Item 9B.
